## Features in Progress 💪

The following features are expected to be released in future versions. 

### Checking for multi-collinearity using Variable Inflation Factor (VIF)

> R2 is 1 for a model that perfectly fits the observed data, i.e. fi=yi for all i.
> If the model predicts ymean always then SSres=SStot and R2=0, this indicates a baseline model to which all other models can be compared.
> Any model that performs worse than the baseline model will have a negative R2 score.
> 
> After computing R2 score, we might overlook and pursue with the model with high R2 value.
> However, R^2 value is determined to find out how well an independent variable is described by the other independent variables. A high value of R^2 means that the variable is highly correlated with the other variables. This is captured by the VIF which is denoted as
>  VIF =  1 / (1- R^2). Hence, it is important to always check for multi-collinearity before pursuing any model as the favourable choice.

### Uploading of data as an input to store into SQL database for time-series analysis
> It will be published in herokuapp.com which is supported with SQL database server
